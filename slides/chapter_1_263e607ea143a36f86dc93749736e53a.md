## Lesson 1.3: Use Joins to Build a Base Table

```yaml
type: "TitleSlide"
key: "65e3cabd79"
```

`@script`
Welcome to lesson 1.3. In this lesson, we'll start the analysis process by building a base table containing all of our polling data.

Recall from the last lesson that our data is broken up into three tables: one contains "horserace" questions like which candidate you plan to vote for, the next contains demographic data on respondents' age, race, and gender, and the third contains a set of issue questions asked in specific districts.

## Base Tables

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "eef56f2b31"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
Before diving into our analysis, we want to make sure we have all of our data in one place. 

- Align your team on a single data source
- Avoid repeatedly writing joins downstream
- Ensure all questions are identified and addressed by your analysis


`@part2`

`@script`
As analysts, we tend to work with data from a variety of sources, such as the three different tables we're working with for this project. Before diving into our analysis, we want to make sure we have all of our data in one place. By doing so, we can

- Align our team on a single data source. If people have questions about where a data point comes from, we can point them to the base table and the code that built it. 
- Avoid repeatedly writing joins downstream. Without a base table, we'll have to re-write tedious code over and over again. Investing in that process now avoids work down the row. 
- Ensure all questions are identified and addressed by your analysis. When designing a base table, we identify all variables we want to analyze, so if a stakeholder has a question that does not have data in the base table, we can know that before we present our analysis and address those problems proactively.

## SQL Joins

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "6b0044c02e"
center_content: true
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
- Inner Join

```select * 
from jyazman.horserace h inner join jyazman.demographics d on h.respondent_id = d.respondent_id``` 
- Left Join

```select * from jyazman.horserace h left join jyazman.demographics d on h.respondent_id = d.respondent_id```

`@script`
We use joins in SQL to combine data sets. The type of join you want to use is based on how the tables in your database relate to one another and which tables contain the data that is  most important to your analysis. Joins require some form of unique identifier, often called a primary key, to tell SQL that a row from one table matches with a row from the other. We'll focus on two main types of joins for this analysis, but there are more.

INNER JOINS
A combined table is returned containing all rows where the unique identifier from the left table has a match in the right table. All rows that exist in one table but not the other are removed from the resulting output

LEFT JOINS
The output of a left join is a combination of all rows from the left table and all tables from the right table that have a match in the left. 

OTHER JOINS
Additional joins exist that allow us to combine tables in different ways. For example, a cartesian join will return a table with every row from the left table matched to every other row of the right table. For now, let's focus on the main tools we need to build our base table.

## Let's Build Our Base Table

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "7cee5d766a"
```

`@script`
The example code in the previous slides joins the horserace table with the demographics table. But for our case, we also want to analyze responses to issue questions. 

Take a few minutes before we do our analysis to combine all three tables into a single base table.
